# Quickstart: Notion-like workspace

## Goal

Provide a minimal flow to experience the MVP: create a workspace page, edit content, and collaborate
via sharing.

## Steps

1. **Sign in** with a test user account.
2. **Create a new page** in your workspace sidebar and give it a title.
3. **Add content blocks** (paragraph, heading, checklist) and verify they can be edited, reordered,
   and deleted.
4. **Refresh the browser** and confirm the page structure and content are preserved.
5. **Share the page** with another test user as viewer, then as editor.
6. **Verify permissions**:
   - Viewer can read but cannot edit.
   - Editor can modify content, and last-write-wins semantics apply at block level.
7. **Observe performance**: typical pages should load within ~2 seconds and remain responsive while
   scrolling.

## Expected Outcome

A reviewer can follow this quickstart to validate that the MVP meets the core user stories and
success criteria defined in the spec.
